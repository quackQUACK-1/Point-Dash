## Point Dash: Privacy policy
The official privacy policy for Point Dash the game on Google Play

Point Dash is a game created by a sole developer. This game isn't the sort to be defined as a "big game" so there's really no need for any sort of data collection apart from the data required for personalised ads from Unity Ads.
I don't collect any data intentionally and don't sell any data to any 3rd party. The data that does get collected however remains fully private on my part but if you want to find out what Unity Ads does with your data you can read here: https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy
